##Simple Webshop

This is an approach for a small Webshop with configurable products.   
It was written solely for learning purposes and is not inteded for productive use since the test coverage is not 100% and the tests are not high quality.

To get the shop running you'd have to import all the tables proided in the [database folder](https://github.com/tolik518/simple_webshop/tree/master/Documentation/exported_database) by hand.
